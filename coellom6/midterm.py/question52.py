#When analyzing data sets, such as data for human heights or for human weights, a common step is to
# adjust the data. This can be done by normalizing to values between 0 and 1, or throwing away 
#outliers. For this program, adjust the values by subtracting each value from the maximum. Input 
#values should be added to the list until -1 is entered.
#Your program must define and call the function:

def get_max_int(nums)
get_max_int = maximum value 
get_max_int = int(input([0][1])) 
#form a loop that allows postitive nums to be entered but make a stop once -1 integer is entered
if get_max_int += "positive" 
    print(nums)
# allow for positive numbers to run and maje the break introducing int -1 
elif: 
    get_max_int == int(input(-1))
    break 
# if -1 integer is not introduce the get_max_int will return max values in the list 
else: 
    print(get_max_int()) 
    
print(get_max_int)  


#Note: get_max_int() returns the maximum value in the list.
